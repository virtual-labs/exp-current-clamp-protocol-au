1. To study the behaviour of a nerve cell under different physiological conditions by measuring response such as action potential, excitatory   and inhibitory post synaptic potentials and membrane transport mechanism and the effect to drugs.
2. To study how a nerve cell will response when an electric current is applied into the cell.
3. To understand the importance of capacitance and conductance properties of a nerve cell in action potential generation and propagation.
